Davies\r\nwas into his conspiracy theories.\r\n\r\n382\r\n00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.400\r\n- Before or after he went psycho?\r\n- I thought I\'d tied up all the loose ends.\r\n\r\n383\r\n00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.800\r\nIf it\'s something you\'ve added,\r\nlet\'s just take it out.\r\n\r\n384\r\n00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.200\r\n- No, it\'s important.\r\n- Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.\r\n\r\n385\r\n00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.296\r\nI just need the weekend.\r\nI know I can add this new path in.\r\n\r\n386\r\n00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.760\r\n- Oh, it\'s complicated enough.\r\n- Just the weekend. Please.\r\n\r\n387\r\n00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.120\r\n- First thing Monday.\r\n- First thing.\r\n\r\n388\r\n00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.240\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n389\r\n00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.160\r\nShit, I\'ve got to run,\r\nmeeting the John Menzies guys.\r\n\r\n390\r\n00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.720\r\nJust don\'t fuck up.\r\nThere\'s a lot riding on this now.\r\n\r\n391\r\n00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.800\r\nI know.\r\n\r\n392\r\n00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.880\r\nHere. That\'s for you.\r\n\r\n393\r\n00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720\r\nWhat is it?\r\n\r\n394\r\n00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.600\r\nTaped it off the telly.\r\nDocumentary about Jerome.\r\n\r\n395\r\n00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.160\r\nA bit of inspiration maybe.\r\nPop it on while you work.\r\n\r\n396\r\n00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.400\r\nAre you having a film night?\r\n\r\n397\r\n00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.960\r\nSugar Puffs from Quaker.\r\n\r\n398\r\n00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.480\r\nTell them about the honey, yummy.\r\n\r\n399\r\n00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.960\r\nTowards the end of his life,\r\n\r\n400\r\n00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.320\r\nDavies was apparently self-administering\r\nhallucinogens on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n401\r\n00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.680\r\nThis, coupled with his attempts\r\n\r\n402\r\n00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.880\r\nto complete the complex multiple\r\nnarratives of Bandersnatch\r\n\r\n403\r\n00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.800\r\nwas to prove the final straw.\r\n\r\n404\r\n00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.840\r\nHe became obsessed\r\nwith bizarre symbols\r\n\r\n405\r\n00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.280\r\nand the limitations\r\nof his own free will.\r\n\r\n406\r\n00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.400\r\nIn his notes,\r\nDavies repeatedly sketched a glyph\r\n\r\n407\r\n00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.840\r\nwhich to him represented multiple fates,\r\npotential realities splitting in two.\r\n\r\n408\r\n00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.720\r\nIt was the start\r\nof his complete mental collapse.\r\n\r\n409\r\n00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.240\r\nDavies became convinced\r\nhe had no control over his fate\r\n\r\n410\r\n00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.640\r\nbecause his wife was spiking him\r\nwith psychoactive drugs\r\n\r\n411\r\n00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.160\r\nat behest of a demon called Pax,\r\na sort of lion figure\r\n\r\n412\r\n00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.680\r\nwho he claimed he\'d seen in a vision,\r\n\r\n413\r\n00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.800\r\nand who ended up\r\nbeing incorporated into the book.\r\n\r\n414\r\n00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.240\r\nIt was this that led him to kill her.\r\n\r\n415\r\n00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.640\r\nHe decapitated her and daubed the\r\nglyph symbol on the walls with her blood.\r\n\r\n416\r\n00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.840\r\nAfter his arrest, he told police\r\n\r\n417\r\n00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.280\r\nwe exist within\r\nmultiple parallel realities at once.\r\n\r\n418\r\n00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.720\r\nOne reality for each possible course\r\nof action we might take in life.\r\n\r\n419\r\n00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.720\r\nWhatever we choose to do\r\nin this existence,\r\n\r\n420\r\n00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.000\r\nthere\u2019s another one out there\r\nin which we\u2019re doing quite the opposite,\r\n\r\n421\r\n00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.920\r\nwhich renders free will meaningless.\r\nNothing but an illusion.\r\n\r\n422\r\n00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.760\r\nIf you follow that line of thinking\r\nto its logical conclusion...\r\n\r\n423\r\n00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.360\r\n...they\'re not even your actions.\r\n\r\n424\r\n00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.640\r\nYour fate has been dictated,\r\nit\'s out of your hands.\r\n\r\n425\r\n00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.480\r\n- You\'re just a puppet.\r\n- Shh, shh, shh.\r\n\r\n426\r\n00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.640\r\nYou\'re not in control.\r\n\r\n427\r\n00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.760\r\nI\'m concerned about you, OK?\r\n\r\n428\r\n00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.320\r\nYou need to speak to her.\r\n\r\n429\r\n00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.520\r\nI\'m concerned about you, OK?\r\n\r\n430\r\n00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.160\r\nYou need to speak to her.\r\n\r\n431\r\n00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.400\r\nI\'m concerned about you, OK?\r\n\r\n432\r\n00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.000\r\nYou need to speak to her.\r\n\r\n433\r\n00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.240\r\nI\'m concerned about you, OK?\r\n\r\n434\r\n00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.800\r\nDavies became convinced\r\nhe had no control over his fate\r\n\r\n435\r\n00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.720\r\nbecause his wife was spiking him\r\nwith psychoactive drugs.\r\n\r\n436\r\n00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.160\r\nIt was this that led him to kill her.\r\n\r\n437\r\n00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.480\r\nHe decapitated her and daubed the\r\nglyph symbol on the walls with her blood.\r\n\r\n438\r\n00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.440\r\nAfter his arrest, he told

why not commit murder?\r\n\r\n449\r\n00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.640\r\nMaybe that\'s what destiny wants.\r\n\r\n450\r\n00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.320\r\nYou\'re just a puppet.\r\n\r\n451\r\n00:37:08.920
